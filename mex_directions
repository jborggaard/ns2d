Mex Instructions

Tested in MATLAB_2014a:

On a Mac: Install XCode (open it an add command line tools)

          in /Applications/MATLAB_2014a/bin (your directory may vary,
          perhaps find it with "which matlab?")
          edit mexopts.sh
          replace 10.7 with 10.11 (or your current version) everywhere
          (save)

          sh ./mexopts.sh

Edit the two *.prj files and replace /Users/jborggaa with the path to your
ns2d directory

mex -setup
